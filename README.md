## Summary

This is the Unity3d SDK of adjust™. It supports iOS, Android, Windows Phone 8 and Windows Store App targets. You can read more about adjust™ at [adjust.com].

## Basic Installation

These are the minimal steps required to integrate the adjust SDK into your
Unity3d project.

### 1. Get the SDK

Download the latest version from our [releases page][releases]. Download the
unityPackge in a folder of your choice.

### 2. Add it to your project

Open your project in the Unity Editor and navigate to `Assets → Import Package → Custom Package` and select the downloaded unityPackage file.

![][import_package]


### 3. Integrate adjust into your app

Add the prefab located at `Assets/Adjust.prefab` to the first scene.

Edit the parameters of the Adjust script in the Inspector menu of the added prefab.

![][adjust_editor]

Replace `{YourAppToken}` with your App Token. You can find in your [dashboard].

You can increase or decrease the amount of logs you see by changing the value
of `Log Level` to one of the following:

- `Verbose` - enable all logging
- `Debug` - enable more logging
- `Info` - the default
- `Warn` - disable info logging
- `Error` - disable warnings as well
- `Assert` - disable errors as well

Depending on whether or not you build your app for testing or for production
you must change `Environment` with one of these values:

```
    'Sandbox'
    'Production'
```

**Important:** This value should be set to `Sandbox` if and only if you or
someone else is testing your app. Make sure to set the environment to
`Production` just before you publish the app. Set it back to `Sandbox` when you
start testing it again.

We use this environment to distinguish between real traffic and artificial
traffic from test devices. It is very important that you keep this value
meaningful at all times! Especially if you are tracking revenue.

If your app makes heavy use of event tracking, you might want to delay some
HTTP requests in order to send them in one batch every minute. You can enable
event buffering by ticking the box for `Event Buffering`.

If you don't want to start the adjust SDK at the `Awake` event of the game, tick the box `Start Manually`. Call the method `Adjust.appDidLaunch` with the respective parameters to start the adjust SDK instead.

For an example of scene with of a button menu with these options and others, open the example scene located at
`Assets/ExampleGUI/ExampleGUI.unity`. The source for this scene is located at `Assets/ExampleGUI/ExampleGUI.cs`.

#### Windows Store Apps

Currently for the Windows Store Apps target only the typle `C++` solutions are functional. This include the `D3D11 C++ Solution` and the `XAML C++ Solution` types.

By default, the Windows Store Apps target apps do not have the Internet client capability activated. To activate it, first switch to the target `Windows Store App` in the `File → Build Settings...` menu. Click the `Player Settings...` button on the `Build Settings`. In the main Unity3d window, the `Inspector` tab will be selected with the Windows Store App settings. Expand the `Publishing Settings` list. Find the `Capabilities` box on the bottom and tick the `InternetClient` checkbox button.

Unfortunatly the Windows Store Apps target apps generated by Unity3d does not link correctly the assembly `System.Core`. The consequense is that, some `System.IO.FileLoadException` errors from different libraries are generated on the first build. To correct it, just build again. This time the assembly should to be correctly linked.

### 4. Build scripts

To facilitate the build process we integrated build scripts for both Android and iOS. The script runs after each build and is called by the file `Assets/Editor/AdjustEditor.cs`. They require at least `python 2.7` installed to work.

It's possible to disable the post processing by clicking on the menu `Adjust → Change post processing status`.
Press the same button to re-enable it.

#### iOS

The iOS build script is located at `Assets/Editor/AdjustPostBuildiOS`. It changes the Unity3d iOS generated project in
the following ways:

1. Adds the adSupport framework to the project. It is needed for the adjust SDK, consult the adjust
[iOS][ios] page for more details.

2. Adds the compilation flag `-fobjc-arc` to the adjust project files in the project. This allows the adjust `ARC` based project to work with the `non-ARC` Unity3d iOS project.

3. Enables the flag `GCC_ENABLE_OBJC_EXCEPTIONS`, to allow the adjust SDK to use objective-c exceptions.

If you have a custom build that puts the Unity3d iOS generated project in a different location,
inform the script by clicking on the menu `Adjust → Set iOS build path` and choosing the build path of the iOS project.

After running, the script writes the log file `AdjustPostBuildiOSLog.txt` at the root of the Unity3d project with log
messages of the script run.

#### Android

The android build script is located at `Assets/Editor/AdjustPostBuildAndroid`. It changes the `AndroidManifest.xml` file
located at `Assets/Plugins/Android/`. The problem with this approach is that, the manifest file used for the Android
package was the one before the build process ended.

To mitigate this, simply run the build again, using the manifest created or changed by the previous run, or click on the menu `Adjust → Fix AndroidManifest.xml` so the script can run before the build process. Either way, it is only necessary to do this step once, as long the manifest file remains compatible with the adjust SDK.

![][menu_android]

If there is not a `AndroidManifest.xml` file at `Assets/Plugins/Android/` it creates a copy from our compatible manifest
file `AdjustAndroidManifest.xml`. If there is already an `AndroidManifest.xml` file, it checks and changes the following:

1. Adds a broadcast receiver. For more details consult the adjust [Android][android] page for more details.

2. Adds the permission to connect to the internet.

3. Adds the permission to access information about Wi-Fi networks.

After running, the script writes the log file `AdjustPostBuildAndroidLog.txt` at the root of the Unity3d project with log
messages of the script run.

## Additional features

Once you integrated the adjust SDK into your project, you can take advantage
of the following features.

### 5. Add tracking of custom events.

You can tell adjust about every event you want. Suppose you want to track
every tap on a button. You would have to create a new Event Token in your
[dashboard]. Let's say that Event Token is `abc123`. In your button's
click handler method you could then add the following line to track the click:

```cs
Adjust.TrackEvent("abc123");
```

You can also register a callback URL for that event in your [dashboard] and we
will send a GET request to that URL whenever the event gets tracked. In that
case you can also put some key-value-pairs in an object and pass it to the
`trackEvent` method. We will then append these named parameters to your
callback URL.

For example, suppose you have registered the URL
`http://www.adjust.com/callback` for your event with Event Token `abc123` and
execute the following lines:

```cs
Dictionary<string,string> parameters = new Dictionary<string, string>();
parameters.Add("key","value");
parameters.Add("foo","bar");

Adjust.TrackEvent("abc123", parameters);
```

In that case we would track the event and send a request to:

```
http://www.adjust.com/callback?key=value&foo=bar
```

It should be mentioned that we support a variety of placeholders like `{idfa}`
for iOS or `{android_id}` for Android that can be used as parameter values.  In
the resulting callback the `{idfa}` placeholder would be replaced with the ID
for Advertisers of the current device for iOS and the `{android_id}` would be
replaced with the AndroidID of the current device for Android. Also note that
we don't store any of your custom parameters, but only append them to your
callbacks.  If you haven't registered a callback for an event, these parameters
won't even be read.

### 6. Add tracking of revenue

If your users can generate revenue by clicking on advertisements or making
in-app purchases you can track those revenues. If, for example, a click is
worth one cent, you could make the following call to track that revenue:

```cs
Adjust.TrackRevenue(1.0);
```

The parameter is supposed to be in cents and will get rounded to one decimal
point. If you want to differentiate between different kinds of revenue you can
get different Event Tokens for each kind. Again, you need to create those Event
Tokens in your [dashboard]. In that case you would make a call like this:

```cs
Adjust.TrackRevenue(1.0, "abc123");
```

Again, you can register a callback and provide a dictionary of named
parameters, just like it worked with normal events.

```cs
Dictionary<string,string> parameters = new Dictionary<string, string>();
parameters.Add("key","value");
parameters.Add("foo","bar");

Adjust.TrackRevenue(1.0, "abc123", parameters);
```

### 7. Receive delegate callbacks

Every time your app tries to track a session, an event or some revenue, you can
be notified about the success of that operation and receive additional
information about the current install. Follow these steps to implement a
delegate to this event.

Please make sure to consider [applicable attribution data policies.][attribution_data]

1. Create a method with the signature of the delegate `Action<ResponseData>`.

2. After calling the launch of the adjust SDK, call the `Adjust.SetResponseDelegate`
with the previously created method. It is also be possible to use a lambda with the same signature.

3. If instead of using the `Adjust.prefab`, the `Adjust.cs` script was added to another `GameObject`.
Don't forget to pass the name of that `GameObject` as the second parameter of `Adjust.SetResponseDelegate`.

The delegate method will get called every time any activity was tracked or
failed to track. Within the delegate method you have access to the
`responseData` parameter. Here is a quick summary of its attributes:

- `ActivityKind activityKind` indicates what kind of activity was tracked. It has
one of these values:

```
Session
Event
Revenue
```

- `string activityKindString` human readable version of the activity kind.
Possible values:

```
session
event
revenue
```

- `bool success` indicates whether or not the tracking attempt was
  successful.
- `bool willRetry` is true when the request failed, but will be retried.
- `string error` an error message when the activity failed to track or
  the response could not be parsed. Is `null` otherwise.
- `string trackerToken` the tracker token of the current install. Is `null` if
  request failed or response could not be parsed.
- `string trackerName` the tracker name of the current install. Is `null` if
  request failed or response could not be parsed.

```cs
using com.adjust.sdk;

public class ExampleGUI : MonoBehaviour {
{
    void OnGUI () {
    {
        if (GUI.Button (new Rect (0, 0, Screen.width, Screen.height),
		                "callback")) {
			Adjust.setResponseDelegate(responseDelegate);
		}
    }

    public void responseDelegate (ResponseData responseData)
	{
		Debug.Log ("activityKind " + responseData.activityKindString);
		Debug.Log ("trackerName " + responseData.trackerName);
		//...
	}
}
```

### 8. Disable tracking

You can disable the adjust SDK from tracking by invoking the method `setEnabled`
with the enabled parameter as `false`. This setting is remembered between sessions, but it can only
be activated after the first session.

```cs
Adjust.setEnabled(enabled: false);
```

You can verify if the adjust SDK is currently active with the method `isEnabled`. It is always possible
to activate the adjust SDK by invoking `setEnabled` with the enabled parameter as `true`.

## Possible problems

### iOS
Even with the post build script it is possible that the project is not ready to run out of the box.

If needed, disable dSYM File. In the `Project Navigator`, select the `Unity-iPhone` project. Click the `Build Settings` tab and search for `debug information`. There should be an `Debug Information Format` or `DEBUG_INFORMATION_FORMAT` option. Change it from `DWARF with dSYM File` to `DWARF`.

### Build scripts

The post build scripts require execute permissions to be able to run. If the build process freezes in the end and opens one of the script files, this may be that your system is configured to not allow scripts to run by default. If this is the case, use the `chmod` tool in both `Assets/Editor/AdjustPostBuildiOS` and `Assets/Editor/AdjustPostBuildAndroid` to add execute privileges.
